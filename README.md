Repository to replicate the results of our experiments.

To train, run the following command:
`sh run.sh`

To test, run the following command:
`sh run_test.sh`

We have provided the checkpoints but unforntunately we can not provide the dataset used in the experiments due to extremely large size of the dataset and copyright issues.

`Uganda2012Consumption_cluster.csv` contains the latitude/longitude and poverty scores for all the villages. We used this to pull satellite images from both Digital Globe Satellites (High-Res) and Sentinel-2 (Low-Res).
